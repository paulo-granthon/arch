# Arch
Automated Arch Linux post installation routine.
# What it does
- Installs my essential packages
- Sets up the github-cli and calls `gh auth login`
- Clones my dot-files for [NeoVim](github.com/paulo-granthon/nvim), [Alacritty](github.com/paulo-granthon/alacritty) and [AwesomeWM](github.com/paulo-granthon/awesomewm)
- Allows me to choose between my custom themes for `AwesomeWM` through the terminal
# Why?
Those configs are built with time. It's good to have a way to get back on track if something happens to the hardware
